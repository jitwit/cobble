* Cobble

A reasonably fast boggle solver implemented in [[https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/][ChezScheme]].

The key is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton][dawg]] data structure, which is like a trie, but with
shared subtrees. I was previously using a trie, but the load time was
a bit excessive.

* Dependencies

+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/hemlock][hemlock]] - data structures
+ [[https://github.com/fedeinthemix/chez-matchable][chez-matchable]] - convenience
