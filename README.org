* Cobble

A reasonably fast boggle solver implemented in [[https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/][ChezScheme]]. I use this
to generate boards for [[https://github.com/jitwit/gobble][gobble]], a multiplayer boggle game. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~ time gobbler -n 10000 -dawg cobble/share/collins.fasl -stdout > /dev/null

real	0m3.439s
user	0m3.412s
sys	0m0.027s
#+end_example

The secret sauce is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton][dawg]] data structure, which is like a trie, but
with shared subtrees. I was previously using a trie, but the load time
was a bit excessive. Solve times are similar with the two structures,
though implementing a dawg gave a definite boost there, too.
